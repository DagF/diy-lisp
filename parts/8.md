## Part 8: the meta-circular evaluator

Yay, you've already implemented your language, and even used it to create some code. Well done!

*But wait, there's more!*

In this last part, we will be implementing the `evaluate` function again, but this time in your brand new language.

It would be easy to make our Python version of `evaluate` available in the language, but it's way more fun to create it using the Lisp itself. 
Besides, it kind of makes your language into a [meta-circular evaluator][meta-circular], which is wicked cool!

In this section, we'll start off by implementing a couple of new control structures. 
Then we'll piece by piece stitch together the `evaluate` function.

```bash
nosetests tests/test_8_meta_circular_evaluator.py --stop
```
